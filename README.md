JKEasyAFNetworking
==================

This is the block based project to facilitate API communications using AFNetwroking APIs

I completely build this project on AFNetworking project hosted at https://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking based off of a version 1.3.3

This is simple APIs to deal with all complexities of networking methods. Including all core API methods provided through a transparent access.
